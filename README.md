# Django-project
This is an ecommerce website built with Django and Bootstrap 4. 
* The website displays products.
* New user can sign up.
* Users can add and remove products to/from their cart while also specifying the quantity of each item after login.
* Users can see their order after placing it.

***This Django-powered ecommerce website design provides a lovely reminder that the virtues of clean simplicity arenâ€™t a lost art, while adding just enough dynamism and quirkiness to excite.***
